# PhotoFrameScale
 
A simple and small Python project using Pillow 
to create scaled representations of JPG images 
to display in a Samsung Photo Frame 
featuring a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels.

Transfer files from subdirectory _xxx to target subdirectory xxx.
Use target subdirectory name as image title, 
unless the individual photo has a subject which then is the image caption.
If the individual photo's subject ends with a hashmark #,
then the caption is concatenated from the target subdirectory name with a dash and
the image description.
